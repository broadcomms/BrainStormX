00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Welcome back to BrainStormX. In this feature deep dive we unpack the intelligence that powers every workshop.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Setup assistants design agendas automatically from your objectives, participants, and timing. Choose a template or let Nova craft a bespoke experience with guardrails and icebreakers.

3
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Every participant enters a personal capture lane that ensures equitable contribution. Quiet teammates get gentle nudges while dominant voices are slowed to keep the pace balanced.

4
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The clustering intelligence watches ideas in real time, groups them into themes, and publishes context cards with AI summaries your team can edit on the fly.

5
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Voting modes adapt to the needs of each session. Use dot voting, pairwise battles, or ROI scoring and BrainStormX handles the timers, tallies, and fairness weights.

6
00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Feasibility analytics surface the most actionable ideas instantly. Cost, complexity, and strategic fit scores are generated by Nova's mixture-of-experts models for every cluster.

7
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Action orchestration writes Jira or Linear tickets, assigns owners, and adds success metrics so momentum never stalls when the workshop ends.

8
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The insights hub stores transcripts, highlights, and executive summaries with version history so stakeholders can replay every decision.

9
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Use the performance dashboard to compare workshops, track participation health, and demonstrate innovation ROI to leadership.

10
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:30.000
