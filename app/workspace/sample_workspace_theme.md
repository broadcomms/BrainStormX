## Facilitator Guidelines

* Encourage specific, SMB-friendly solutions (avoid only “enterprise-scale” ideas).
* Push for practicality: can this be adopted by a 20-person company?
* Keep the group grounded in outcomes rather than abstract ethics.
* Time-box each stage to ensure all agenda items are covered.

---

## Facilitator Tips

* Use a **live poll** during voting to make prioritization interactive.
* Show quick examples of “good” vs “bad” AI transparency to inspire ideas.
* Capture risks and mitigations side-by-side on the board for clarity.
* Summarize each cluster aloud before moving into voting.

## Executive Summary (sample output text for demo)

> The **Responsible AI for SMBs workshop** surfaced nine practical interventions ranging from lightweight governance templates to AI explainability KPIs. Participants agreed the top priorities were **bias testing with synthetic datasets**, **model card checklists**, and a **risk register template**. A 30-60-90 day roadmap was drafted, with immediate pilots in data retention policies and incident escalation playbooks. Judges noted the strong balance between feasibility and ethical rigor.

Do you want me to also **create a JSON payload** for this workspace (like `AgendaPayloadModel` output) so you can directly load and demo it inside BrainStormX?
